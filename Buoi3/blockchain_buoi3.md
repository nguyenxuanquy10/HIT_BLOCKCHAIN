<strong>What is proof of work ?</strong>
<br>

<p>Proof-of-stake underlies certain consensus mechanisms used by blockchains to achieve distributed consensus
Ethereum uses proof-of-stake, where validators explicitly stake capital in the form of ETH into a smart contract on Ethereum. This staked ETH then acts as collateral that can be destroyed if the validator behaves dishonestly or lazily. The validator is then responsible for checking that new blocks propagated over the network are valid and occasionally creating and propagating new blocks themselves.</p>
<strong>How does proof of stake work ?</strong>
<br>
<p>Proof of stake (PoS) relies on validators who own the coins associated with the blockchain. With proof of stake, a validator is chosen randomly, based in part on how many coins they have locked up in the blockchain network, also known as staking. The coins act as collateral and when a participant, or node, is chosen to validate a transaction, they receive a reward.</p>

<strong>What Is Gas (Ethereum)?</strong>
<br>
<p>
Gas is the fee required to successfully conduct a transaction or execute a contract on the Ethereum blockchain platform. Fees are priced in tiny fractions of the cryptocurrency ether (ETH)â€”denominations called gwei (10-9 ETH). Gas is used to pay validators for the resources needed to conduct transactions.

<br>
<strong>How can estimate fee of each transaction ? </strong>
<br>
<p>The exact price of the gas is determined by supply, demand, and network capacity at the time of the transaction.</p>

<strong>Storage and memory in solidy  </strong>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Memory in Solidity is a temporary place to store data.The Solidity Smart Contract can use any amount of memory during the execution but once the execution stops, the Memory is completely wiped off for the next execution.</li>
<li>
Storage holds data between function calls. Each execution of the Smart contract has access to the data previously stored on the storage area.
</li>
<li>The difference between storage and memory in solidity is environment that they can execute .Memory is wiped off for the next execution and storage is existed in block forever</li>
</ul>
