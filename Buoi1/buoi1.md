<strong>Blockchain</strong>
<br>
Let's move below question
<br>
<strong>When blockchain invent ??</strong>
<br>
In 2008, Blockchain is created by Satoshi to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transaction
<br>
<strong>What is blockchain ??</strong><br>
Blockchain is distributed database that has many "node" .Each node in system in the network shares the same copy of record .And node is sequence blocks in order, and each node is linked by hash of previous block.
<br>
<strong>What is a structure block in node ??</strong><br>
Each block contains header and body .Header is used to indentify a particular block on an entire blockchain , it includes hash of previous block, time stamp , nonce, and merkle root<br>
Hash of previous block : the hashed value of the previous node’s address<br>
Time stamp : is used as proof that the particular block is used at what instance of a time, also this timestamp is used as a parameter to verify the authenticity of any block.<br>
Nonce : is a number added to hashed or enctypted to block . It is used to verify transactions<br>
merkle root :<br>
Body contains transaction data : ( em đang nghiên cứu thêm ạ )
<br>
<strong>How is block link in blockchain ? </strong><br>
Block are linked using cryptography know as hash of previous of block 

<strong>How is blockchain immutable? </strong><br>
One of the key elements that make blockchain immutable is cryptographic hashes.The advantage of hash that it cannot be reverse-engineered .The hash vlue is generated separately for each block . Every proceeding block contain a hash for itself and also the hash of previous block .So any intruder has to change the hash value from the first list to the last block which is impossible .Also an important fact is blockchain are decentralized and distributed in nature, anh it has many replica node  arround the networld
<br>
<strong>How is blockchain decentrailization ?</strong><br>
Decentralised means that a decision is made across various nodes. Each node decides its behaviour, which ultimately affects the system’s behaviour. This ensures that no single node has complete system information.<br>
<strong>How is blockchain distributed ? </strong> <br>
Distributed ledgers use independent computers (referred to as nodes) to record, share and synchronize transactions in their respective electronic ledgers (instead of keeping data centralized as in a traditional ledger)
<strong>How is blockchain authentication ?</strong><br>
All parts of the system are located in different physical locations. The processing is spread across multiple nodes, but decision making can be centralised or decentralised.
